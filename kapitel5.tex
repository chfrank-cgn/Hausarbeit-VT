\section{Summary}

\onehalfspacing

Non-Violent Communication, or Compassionate Communication, is a great tool to support awareness and conflict resolution processes in groups.

Based on its fundamentally humanistic approach to human interaction, NVC provides practical guidelines for establishing appreciative communication, which can help prevent conflicts from arising and support defusing conflict situations.

We found that an awareness team educated in NVC can greatly benefit large social gatherings and groups, and we can recommend exploring the concepts behind NVC further.

May all beings have happiness and its causes!
